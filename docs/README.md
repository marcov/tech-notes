# Personal Technical Notes & Documentation

These are the technical notes & documentation I maintain. PR's welcome!

I'm not providing a ToC to keep the maintenance burden to a minimum:

- content is categorized by directories hierarchy

- when served as HTML, an index should be auto-generated by the documentation
  platform

## Meta
I am using _Read the Docs_ with `mkdocs` to auto-generate HTML from Markdown.
For local development & testing run this command from the repository root:
```
# (This assumes mkdocs is available on your system)
$ mkdocs serve [-a LISTEN-IP:LISTEN-PORT] [--livereload]
```
