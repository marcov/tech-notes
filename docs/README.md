# Personal Technical Notes & Documentation

Self-maintained technical notes & documentation, forming my technical
[PKM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management).
PR's are welcome!

To keep the maintenance burden to a minimum, the content is only cataloged
using directories. No other indexes are provided.

However, using a documentation platform such as _Read the Docs_, you are able
to auto-generated a hierarchical view of this content.

## Read the Docs

I am using _Read the Docs_ + `mkdocs` to auto-generate HTML from Markdown.
For local development & testing, this command will bring up a local webserver
rendering documentation pages:

```console
$ mkdocs serve [-a LISTEN-IP:LISTEN-PORT] [--livereload]
```
