# Personal Technical Notes & Documentation

These are self-maintained technical notes & documentation forming my [PKM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management).
PR's are welcome!

To keep the maintenance burden to a minimum, the content is only cataloged using
directories and no index is provided.

However an index can be easily auto-generated by a documentation platform such as
_Read the Docs_.

## Read the Docs
I am using _Read the Docs_ + `mkdocs` to auto-generate HTML from Markdown.
For local development & testing, this command will bring up a local webserver
rendering documentation pages:
```
$ mkdocs serve [-a LISTEN-IP:LISTEN-PORT] [--livereload]
```
