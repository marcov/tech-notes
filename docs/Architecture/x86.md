# x86 Architecture Notes

## Processor modes
- Real:
  * x86(-64) boots in this mode
  * Addresses always correspond to real locations in memory and I/O
  * Address space: 20-bit (1MiB) (segmented) memory address space

- Protected:
  * Entered from real mode
  * Introduces the privileges rings 0-3
  * Allow to use virtual memory and multi tasking

- Virtual (legacy):
  * No more available on x86-64 (uses VT-X instead)
  * HW virtualization technique to allow running real mode applications in protected mode

- Long:
  * Access to 64-bit instructions and registers

## Rings
- Ring 0: kernel / supervisor
- Ring 1,2: (not really used)
- Ring 3: applications / user

## x86-64

- 4-level paging mode
- 64-bit virtual address format. But in current implementation:
    * only the low-order 48 bits are used
    * most significant 16 bits of any virtual address, bits 48 through 63, must be copies of bit 47
      (Canonical form)
        *  `0                 - 00007FFF'FFFFFFFF`
        *  `FFFF8000'00000000 - FFFFFFFF'FFFFFFFF`

- 48-bit physical addresses: can address up to 256 TB of RAM

## VT-x
- CPU virtualization technology.
- Root / non-root mode (orthogonal to Processor modes)
- Root: hypervisor, Non-root: guest
- VMX: instructions for VT-x handling (VMXON, VMXOFF, VMXLAUNCH, VMXRESUME).
- A VMCS mem region (4kB) for each vCPU

### QEMU
- A process per VM
- A thread per vCPU (VMCS)
- Emulates I/O
